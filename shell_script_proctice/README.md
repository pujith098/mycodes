The script includes examples of:

- **Variables & Command Substitution**
- **Arithmetic operations**
- **Arrays**
- **Conditional statements** (`if/else`)
- **Case statements** (`case/esac`)
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `until`)

## üìÇ Script Flow

1. Greet user with variables and current date  
2. Perform basic arithmetic operations  
3. Demonstrate arrays and access elements  
4. Use `if/else` to compare numbers  
5. Take user input and process with `case`  
6. Print sequences using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops  
7. Define and call a function with arguments  
8. Perform string operations (length, substring, replace)  
9. Create and read from a file `demo.txt`  
10. Use `trap` to handle `Ctrl+C` and clean up
